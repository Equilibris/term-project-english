# Task: How can people succeed in life despite having a health condition or disability &mdash; the dyslectic difference

> So i chose the task: How can people succeed in life despite having a health condition or disability
> We can all agree that being dead is a problem, maybe even a personal problem
> What will climate change do? Correct; kill us.
> Thats why my presentation on a personal issue will be the powers of nuclear energy as an alternative power source
> Just kidding of course, i am not that insane,
> But i am illiterate

> Oh sorry dyslectic

```

> And i can guarantee that this is one of the reasons i've reached where i am today
> I could easily say that that is my greatest superpower
> But before i start i would like to hear what you guys think about dyslexia

_Prompt conversation_

```
* Reading disability
* Slower at language
* Harder to learn

```

> What did i do there?
> **This:**

_Animate in simpler code_

```ts
const buildGoogleUrl = (prompt: string) =>
	`https://www.google.com/search?q=${prompt.replace(' ', '+')}&tbm=isch`

async function getImages(prompt: string) {
	const htmlSource: string = await (await fetch(buildGoogleUrl(prompt))).text()
	const imageSources: string[] = getImagesFromHtml(htmlSource)

	return imageSources
}
```

> But back to topic
> Contrary to popular belief; dyslexia is not an error in the lexical proceeding directives of the brain

```
Brain of an average moogus

*image of clean wires from among us*
```

> But rather a complete reformat of the brain

```
Brain of a dyslectic moogus (sus)

*Image of absolutely fucked yet correct wires*
```

> If you see here they are still correct yet the paths don't really make sense
> An effect of this is shittier lexical processing <!-- No shit this line could be better -->
> Don't believe me?

> Lets see the contrary, what skills are boosted through dyslexia
> Remember this

```
*Return to code slide*
```

> This is Javascript, its like python but different
> What is javascript, its a programming ...

_Prompt conversation_

> Correct a programming _language_
> What was that Dyslexia was bad at again?
> Yeah, _language_
> But what makes programming different?
> As many of you might be aware, it is **hard**
> This means the brain does not categorize it as a language, nor maths
> It catagories it as _Novel-Problem-Solving_
> This means its equivalent with trying to solve a very hard problem
> And can we all agree that solving new, up-and-coming problems is more useful than being able to analyze a short story?
> Obviously

> To wrap things up
> I missed the task again!
> Ooooh no my grade is trembling in fear
> But _how?_
> Well, dyslexia is **not** a disadvantage &mdash; despite whatever pop-culture makes you think
> Dyslexia is a difference, and it needs to be treated as that
> The world cannot continue to try to progress forward though only transforming into one
> The world has to do a retrograde burn and view peoples differences as unique superpowers

> Thanks for your attention :D
